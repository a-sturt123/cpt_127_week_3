# Objective: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the sum, average, and largest number in the list.



# Problem 1: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the sum of all the numbers in the list.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

total_sum = sum(numbers)

print(f"Sum: {total_sum}")


# Problem 2: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the average of all the numbers in the list.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

print(f"Average: {average}")


# Problem 3: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the largest number in the list.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

largest_number = max(numbers)

print(f"Largest number: {largest_number}")
